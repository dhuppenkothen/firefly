Modelling Pile-Up in X-ray Data Using ABC
=========================================

This software aims to model pile-up of photon count data 
in X-ray instruments (both CCDs and proportional counters) 
via simulations and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC).

This is still a work in progress, so bugs and problems are likely.
